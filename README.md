# about GFW
The packagecontrol.io is "greened" recently, so we could NOT access it anymore :(.

However, there is a "window" while door is closed.

Actually only the domain name packagecontrol.io is "greened", the ip is still 
reachable, so we could access package control through the url sublime.wbond.net and 
ip:
	sublime.wbond.net has address 50.116.34.243
	sublime.wbond.net has IPv6 address 2600:3c02:e000:42::1

so we could use "Add Channel" in Pacakge Control and input the following two lines
http://50.116.34.243/channel_v3.json

http://sublime.wbond.net/channel_v3.json

http://li424-243.members.linode.com/channel_v3.json
